# Imaginary Data Analysis/Business Analytics task 
by: Beibarys Nyussupov 

As part of a significant restructuring of product lines, AJAX Pharmaceuticals (a fictitious name for a real
company) laid off 24 of 55 assembly line workers in its Pittsburgh manufacturing plant. Citing the ADEA
(Age Discrimination and Employment Act), 11 of the laid-off workers claimed they were discriminated
against on the basis of age and sued AJAX for $5,000,000. Management disputed the claim, saying that
because the workers were essentially interchangeable, they had used random sampling to choose the
24 workers to be terminated. The attached data file lists the 55 assembly line workers and identifies
which were terminated and which remained active. Plaintiffs are denoted by an asterisk. These data
were used by both the plaintiffs and the defendants to determine whether the layoffs had an adverse
impact on workers age 40 and over and to establish the credibility of management’s random sampling
claim.

Using whatever statistical methods you think are appropriate, build a case that supports the plaintiffs’
position. (Call documents related to this issue Exhibit A.) Similarly, build a case that supports the
defendants’ position. (Call these documents Exhibit B.) Then discuss which of the two cases is more
convincing and why.
